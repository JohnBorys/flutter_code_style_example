This repository contains selected code snippets created by Ivan Bilchenko to showcase coding style and approach to development. These code snippets are not intended to compile or represent a full, working project. Instead, they provide a sample of code structure, conventions, and methodologies used.

To avoid error highlighting, all files are provided with .txt extensions instead of .dart.

A full project demonstrating a complete working solution is currently in development.
